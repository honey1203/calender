## Core Features:

- Calendar Layout: Generates a monthly calendar layout with days arranged in a grid format. The grid will display each day of the month.
- Dynamic Date Marking: Automatically identifies past dates up to the current day and marks them with a visual indicator (e.g., a cross or grayed-out style).
- Daily Update: Automatically updates the calendar's date markings daily to reflect the passage of time accurately.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for the calendar background.
- Secondary color: White (#FFFFFF) for the day cells.
- Accent: Red (#FF0000) to highlight the current day and crossed-out past dates.
- Grid-based layout for arranging days of the month.
- Use a simple 'X' icon for marking past dates.
- Subtle fade-in effect when the calendar updates daily.
